Windows 10 Theme Collection
===========================
Installation Notes
------------------
1. Before attempting to apply custom themes, create a restore point.


![restore](https://github.com/OliverKurz/windows-10-theme-collection/raw/master/images/restore.png)

2. There is an installer included in "files\patcher" for the theme patcher Theme Signature Bypass, I recommend using it:

![patcher](https://github.com/OliverKurz/windows-10-theme-collection/raw/master/images/patcher.png)

Or trying [UltraUxThemePatcher](https://www.syssel.net/hoefs/software_uxtheme.php?lang=en) instead.

3. These custom themes rely heavily on the correct settings of [OldNewExplorer](http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/170375-oldnewexplorer-118/).
Take a few minutes to download and copy the newest version of ONE to a locaAtion on your filesystem and open ONE as administrator to carefully look at the check boxes you have in your ONE settings and compare them with mine:

![one](https://github.com/OliverKurz/windows-10-theme-collection/raw/master/images/ONE.png)

Once you have made sure you are using the same ONE settings that I am, click install.
If you are new to themeing on newer versions of Windows (8+) and have a problem with your theme not looking right, 90% of the time it is your configuration of ONE.

4. Install [StartIsBack++](http://startisback.com/#download-tab) to skin the start menu and taskbar. Here are a few options that I recommend using:

![sib](https://github.com/OliverKurz/windows-10-theme-collection/raw/master/images/sib.png)


I have included start orbs in "files\orbs". Select the theme's start menu and an orb in the StartIsBack++ configuration and click apply. If it's not an option to choose the theme's start menu, later on you can check once your custom theme is applied.

5. [Winaero Tweaker](https://winaero.com/download.php?view.1796) is the go to application for tweaking the rest of your system.

6. [Aero Glass for Win8.1+](http://www.glass8.eu/) is an optional advanced customization tool worth checking out. I have included my aero glass atlas themes located in "files\atlas-theme-collection", which you could optionally move to your Aero Glass folder if you choose to install it. Aero Glass can be safely installed in the existing "AeroGlass" directory if you chose to install Theme Signature Bypass to patch you system.

Here is how the Aero Glass GUI looks with a custom theme atlas applied:

![Aero_Glass_GUI](https://github.com/OliverKurz/windows-10-theme-collection/raw/master/images/Aero_Glass_GUI.png)



7. Install the fonts included in the "files\fonts" folder. This is another important step (sometimes people forget). Type `ctrl+a` then rc + click "install" with "no" and "do this for all current items" clicked.

8. Merge the reg files in "files\rc_context_menu" so that it's possible to switch themes from the desktop rc menu, and remove the immersive context menus that is present by default from explorer rc menu.

9. Merge the system metrics for the theme you intend to run included in the "files\system_metrics" folder so your window frames will be custom sized and custom fonts will display in their intended locations. You can safely overwrite the settings for a custom system metrics file by merging another.
+ **logout or reboot.**

10. Cut/paste the contents of "themes" into your themes folder (in my experience this has always been "C:\Windows\Resources\Themes"). I had to remove the sounds and have only one wallpaper in the theme folders to limit the download size. Apply your theme via "Control Panel -> Personalization" from the desktop right click options "Personalize (classic) -> Theme Settings".
**I take no responsibility for anyone that bricks their system, use custom themes at your own risk!!**
