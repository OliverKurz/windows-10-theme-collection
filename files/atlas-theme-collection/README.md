Atlas Theme Collection
======================
This is a collection of my themes for Aero Glass on Windows 10 Creators Update. All of these atlas themes were created using my full system themes for Windows 10 Creators Update and the Aero Glass GUI. Download links and the Aero Glass GUI are included. For best results merge the included custom system metrics.reg file found in "files" first, before logging out or restarting and applying an atlas theme. A recommended installation method is to copy this entire folder into the location that Aero Glass is installed in.
In the "windows-10-theme-collection\images" folder you can find aero glass reflection images (they start with Reflection_), which can also be applied in the Aero Glass GUI.

Choosing a theme is a case of enabling theme atlas image in the Aero Glass GUI and browsing to your Aero Glass folder and selecting an atlas image. The explorer address should look something similar to "C:\AeroGlass\dwm-atlas-theme-collection\themes\atlas-image.png".
